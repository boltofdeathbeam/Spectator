To run:
% python spectator.py targets
where targets.list is a file to be read in with
first column = flag (0,1) if target is to be used,
second column = target/directory name"  

This will run both scrape_headers (which generates tables of
information describing the sample) and quick_look, which generates
demographics plots and plots of spectra

Required packages:
 - astropy: http://www.astropy.org/
 - fitsio: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fitsio/
   (soon to be optional if you have astropy)
 - matplotlib
 - Assumes Python 2.


Known issues:

Currently this only works with COS/FUV data, and many of the
peculiarities, both in plotting and scraping the headers for
information, are particular to COS/FUV. That said, it does work for
_all_ COS/FUV data publicly available as of December 2015.
