This is the global TODO list for 50 Megapictures 
————————————————————————————————————————————————

Things we want done by Jan 4:
- coadds of all COS FUV targets (G130M, G160M, G140L)
---includes targname combinations, NED/SIMBAD resolved?
- value added data (also from NED? QSO redshifts, spectral types, ...)
- JavaScript tables
- tables of info (fits and pickle?) of what's actually in each coadd
- GitHub for quicklooks (need better name)
- documentation ...
- hander / flyer! (Need URL)

Release / Publicity
——————————————————
- choose and order USB sticks. ~250 at $15/piece ?  who actually orders them?
- probably ought to spin up procurement sooner rather than later, but need firm capacity limit (8GB / 16GB?) 
- compose list of COS user email addresses to invite interested people by the booth? 
- other advertising? get on listed schedule at booth.
- handout / flyer? 

Quicklooks (MSP) 
————————————————
- y-scaling of NUV in quick look exposure plots [see “IO-210W” for an example of where it goes wrong.]
- are the grey error vectors in the quicklook plots correct? They look too large. 
- keep binning noisy ones until they look OK in quick-looks? 
- EBJ: For the composite spectrum plot, why are there no S/N values given for the colored
bands at longer wavelengths?
- EBJ: I suggest that you replace the current explanation of S/N values with the following statement: 
“Error vectors depicted as a gray trace and S/N values stated for the colored shaded bands represent errors
per pixel in the unsmoothed spectrum.”
- EBJ: Vertical scaling in the plots looks good and thankfully avoids being fooled by the L-alpha emission
or bad pixels at the extreme ends of the spectra.  This is a real improvement over what we often
see in the MAST quick look displays.  The only situations that I found where the scaling was not
optimal was for quasar spectra with very strong emission peaks.  Of course, if you rescale to
show the top of the emission profile, you badly suppress the amplitude of the spectrum elsewhere.
Perhaps a solution to this would be to have the parts clipped at the top “roll over” and reappear
at the bottom, i.e., modulo the intensity value at the top of y-axis in the plot.  Then, one could see the top
of the emission and the continuum level elsewhere at a good scaling, all in a single plot.  You
probably would want to show the rolled over portion in a different color.
- EBJ: What kind of smoothing did you implement for the display?  Box car or Gaussian?  I think
a Gaussian kernel would give slightly better results.
- EBJ: I did not find the flux vs. time plots very interesting (e.g., look at the one for CTS0216).  Even
when I examined the plot for an object that had 60 observations (QSO-J1701+6412), it looks
rather boring.  Is this feature really useful?  Maybe so, but I did not see any cases of this sort.
Incidentally,  the listing for QSO-J1701+6412 seems to be duplicated in two rows.


Sample Tables (JT) 
——————————————————
- ALL EXPOSURE TABLES ARE DEAD OR MISSING! 
- 9.99 and other bogus values in S/N field 
- add FUV L coadd by LP links? (last column) 
- make appropriate downloads available: all, by LP, and filtered x1d list 
- EBJ: You need to resolve the incompatibilities between HST target names defined by users
(according to the rules established by STScI) and those recognized by Simbad or Ned.
Perhaps you could write a program that goes through all the names listed in our
archive and flags those where the name was not recognized.  Then, for those objects
(hopefully not too many), you could establish aliases (unseen to the user) that would
give a name that is acceptable to Simbad and would automatically link to the object.
Here’s a example of such a failure: 1H-2129-624.  Now you could link according to
coordinates, but then the user must make a choice after Simbad presents a list of
objects within some specified angular distance from the target.
- What happened for the target 2QZJ0302-3216?  It looks as if a very poor exposure
with a S/N << 1 came out, as evidenced by the very high error vector and the bar-code
appearance of the spectrum.  OK, no surprise, but what’s the little spectrum underneath
the bar code?
- Danforth: For my own purposes, it would be useful to have a redshift field to sort by.  
However, I realize all too well that this is not a field in the FITS headers or a 
required field in the APT input.  Another useful field would be PI name(s).  
A lot of the time, I can parse whether a dataset would be useful based on who 
proposed for it.
- Danforth: “A few bugs: the MAST links from each object could be position-based 
rather than name based.  Both of the random targets I tried got error messages 
saying that "name X can't be resolved into a position".  Also, S/N and number of 
exposures could have a few less significant figures.”



MAST integration
————————————————
- EBJ: As I mentioned during the meeting, it would be good to have a GUI similar to the 
view/customize plot option for individual exposures in the MAST quick look page.
If you have trouble linking to the program that does this in MAST, perhaps you could
simply steal their code and duplicate it on your own system?




Praise
——————
Ed Jenkins: “I too find the archive nicely organized, easy to use, and potentially very useful for future investigators.
You’ve done a really nice job!”

Charles Danforth: “First of all, I'm super-impressed by the web interface.  It's really cool stuff and fun to delve through. . . . [boring stuff about data]. . . In any case, impressive work, Molly.”
